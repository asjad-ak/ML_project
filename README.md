# Customer Segmentation Analysis

![Clustering Visualization](kmeans_clusters_viz.png)

## Project Overview
This project implements customer segmentation using two clustering algorithms:
- **K-Means** (centroid-based clustering)
- **DBSCAN** (density-based clustering)

The goal is to group customers with similar characteristics for targeted marketing strategies.

## Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Optimal cluster detection
- Visualization of results
- Comparison between K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms
- Model persistence for future use

### Recommended Additions:
1. Add actual screenshots of your visualizations
2. Include a "Key Findings" section with your specific results
3. Add a "Business Applications" section explaining how the clusters can be used
4. Consider adding a "Future Improvements" section
